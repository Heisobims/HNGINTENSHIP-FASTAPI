# Stage 0 Backend - Public API to Retrieve Basic Information

## Overview

This project involves developing a public API that returns basic information in JSON format. The API provides the following details:
- Your registered email address (used to register on the HNG12 Slack workspace).
- The current datetime in ISO 8601 format (UTC).
- The GitHub URL of the project's codebase.

The API is built using Python with the FastAPI framework and deployed to a publicly accessible endpoint. It is designed to be simple, fast, and accessible, with a response time of less than 500ms.

---

## Technology Stack

- Programming Language/Framework: Python (FastAPI)
- Deployment Platform: [Render](https://render.com) (or any other platform of your choice)
- CORS Handling: The API is configured to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) appropriately using FastAPI's built-in CORS middleware.

## API Specification

### Endpoint
- Method: `GET`
- URL: `https://hng-stage0-backend.onrender.com`

### Response Format (200 OK)
The API returns a JSON response with the following structure:
```json
{
  "email": "Heisobims@gmail.com",
  "current_datetime": "2025-01-30T21:04:35Z",
  "github_url": "https://github.com/heisobims/HNGINTENSHIP-FASTAPI"
}
```

### Example Usage
1. Make a `GET` request to the API endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET https://hng-stage0-backend.onrender.com
   ```
2. Sample Response:
   ```json
   {
     "email": "Heisobims@gmail.com",
     "current_datetime": "2025-01-30T21:04:35Z",
